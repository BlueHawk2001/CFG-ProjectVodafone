      <p> Dog Discover is a resource built by the Dog Discover Foundation team.
        Through Dog Discover you will be able to find the perfect dog for you. You can find information about your ideal dog which you can find within our quiz.</p>
      <p>The races presented within our site are probably the most widely-preferred species by humans. Each one is suited to certain "types" and "circumstances" of humans lifestyles.</p>
      <p>Did you know our loyal friends' ancestors are wolves? Back in the prehistoric era, men started domesticating wolves and selectively breeeding them to achieve the animal's submission and obedience. </p>
      <p> In the recent era, dogs are fully domesticated and cannot live in the wild. So if you are looking at a dog to accompany you through the difficulties of life, you are at the right place!</p>
